## Introduction
### Problem Description:
Food allergies are a significant health concern affecting a substantial portion of the global population. Allergic reactions to certain foods can range from mild to severe and, in some cases, may even be life-threatening. The challenge for individuals with food allergies is to avoid consuming products that contain allergens to prevent adverse reactions. Identifying allergens in food items can be complex, as they are often listed by technical names, and
cross-contamination during food processing may occur.
